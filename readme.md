# PNGallery

This is a website that lets users upload a .png and a message of a certain amount of characters to this website.

## The webpages
### Home
The homepage is a gallery of images that previous users have uploaded.

### Sign-up
There's a small sign-up form where the user can make an account as well as upload the .png-file of his choice. This makes sure that every account contributes!

### Changes   
If the user is not happy with the picture he uploaded he can always change his current one out for a new one. Or change the message that displays with his picture.

## Installing
You can install the full application by for example using git:
```bash
git clone  git@github.com:DanielvandeVelde/be-assessment-2.git
cd be-assessment-2
npm install
```
After that you can log-in using mysql. Instead of 'yourusername' you should of course add your own username.
```sh
mysql -u yourusername -p
##and then enter your password
```
Now you still need to make a database:
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS PNGallery;
USE PNGallery;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  username TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  hash TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  png TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  message TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,

  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```
Then you need a [`.env`][dotenv] file. In which you will need to add these few lines and change the values on the right to the actual values:  

```text
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=yourusername
DB_PASS=yourpassword
DB_NAME=PNGallery
SESSION_SECRET=yoursecretword
```
After you only have to start the website by being in the folder and using:
```bash
npm start
```
The website will be on localhost:8000 as default.

## Development
### To-do
- [x] Make gitignore
- [x] Make a mysql database for myself
- [x] Add a .env
- [x] Fix the forms to my needs
- [ ] Fix the EJS-files to my needs
- [ ] Create a patch function and page
- [ ] ESLINT everything!
- [ ] Server side test for .png (Every png file begins with 89504e47)
